Our project this semester focuses on creating a bus app called Sao Paulo Adventure, similar to other bus apps like Illini Bus, made for UIUC students or Transit Stop, a popular app for Chicagoans. Our app implements a stored procedure that will display the number of distinct trips for each starting point, and the average price, ordered from cheapest to most expensive. We have a trigger that will make sure that when users want to select another stop, the corresponding table needs to be updated correctly. Our visualization shows the user the route they will take displayed on a map. They will see what other destinations they will pass by on their trip and be able to plan accordingly.

To run the app, type
```
npm run dev
```
in the terminal

We hope you enjoy!
