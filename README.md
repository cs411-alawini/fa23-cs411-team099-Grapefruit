Our project this semester focuses on creating a bus app called Sao Paulo Adventure, similar to other bus apps like Illini Bus, made for UIUC students or Transit Stop, a popular app for Chicagoans. Our app has a login page along with Favorites tab, Trip Planner tab, and Account tab. They display a user's favorite stops, a route for their planned trip with 2 stops, and a place to update account information, respectively. Our app implements a stored procedure that will display the the average price and classification for trips with the same starting point. We have a trigger that will make sure that when users want to select another stop, the corresponding table is updated correctly. Our visualization shows the user the route they will take displayed on a map. They will see what other destinations they will pass by on their trip and be able to plan accordingly.

To run the app, type
```
npm run dev
```
in the terminal

We hope you enjoy!
