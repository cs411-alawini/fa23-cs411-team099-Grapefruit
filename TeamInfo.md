## Project Summary
Our project is going to be a web application that provides users information about public transportation in Sao Paulo. This information includes fare, nearby stops, and schedules. We are planning on letting users create their own accounts which will allow them to favorite certain stops and routes to easily access the information they need. Our web application will also allow users to plan their trips and provide routes that will get them near their destination within a user-set budget. The user interface will include a map that will allow users to navigate the area and provide information about what routes are available in certain areas. The user interface will also provide the user with information about scheduled times for certain routes depending on whether they are planning a trip or just looking for nearby transportation.
